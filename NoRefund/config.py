Fully or partially unused refundable tickets may be submitted to Redteam Airlines for possible refund. Many tickets contain fare restrictions that limit their refundable value and require fees and/or penalties to be deducted from any refund of the original ticket.

If your paper/printed ticket passes refund eligibility and you submit the refund request, you will be required to mail in your original coupons to Redteam Airlines at the address below before your request can be processed.

Non-Refundable Tickets:

Nonrefundable tickets generally cannot be refunded. However, exceptions may be available under the following circumstances:

Death of the passenger, immediate family member, or traveling companion.

Schedule changes implemented by Redteam Airlines.

Certain illnesses may be considered if your ticket involves international travel, which includes travel to or from the U.S. Virgin Islands or Puerto Rico.

Upon request, taxes and fees not imposed by the airline may be refunded if the airline's obligation to remit the tax or fee depends upon use of the ticket for travel. Taxes and fees will not be refunded if the airline's obligation to remit the tax or fee arises from the collection of the tax or fee. All taxes and fees imposed by the United States government fall within this category and are not refundable.

Subject to certain restrictions and fees defined in the rules of the fare, the value of a wholly unused nonrefundable ticket may only be used toward the purchase of a new nonrefundable ticket. Travel on such reissued tickets (or subsequently reissued tickets) must commence no later than one year from the date of issue of the original ticket. The value of an AA nonrefundable fare can only be applied to the value of another AA nonrefundable fare. The value of an AA non-refundable fare cannot be applied to the purchase of another airline refundable/nonrefundable fare.

For partially used tickets, the residual value may be used toward the purchase of a new nonrefundable ticket. The residual value will be the difference between the fare paid and the fare for the transportation actually used as determined by the applicable rules less any fees or penalties defined in the rules of the fare that was purchased. All travel on such reissued tickets (or subsequently reissued tickets) must be completed no more than one year from the first date of travel on the original ticket or sooner if required by the tickets' fare rules.

In any case, the itinerary for any unused or partially used nonrefundable ticket must be canceled before the ticketed departure time of the first unused coupon, or the ticket will lose any remaining value and cannot be used for travel or reissue.

If your nonrefundable paper/printed ticket passes the above eligibility and you submit the refund request, you will be required to mail in your original coupons to Redteam Airlines at the address below before your request can be processed.
